    "The steps:\n",
    "1. The best estimate of your slope will be the one from your best-fitting model above with the lowest $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$. In this example the best-fitting model is `Slope = 2.08 N/m` and `Intercept = 0.0045 m`, which corresponds to a $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ of 0.66.\n",
    "2. While keeping `Intercept` fixed at `0.0045 m`, we adjust the `Slope` upward until our $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ is approximately $2 \\times 0.66$, which is 1.32. Being within 5% of this value (so ~ 1.25 - 1.39) is precise enough so we can use `slope_max = 2.148 N/m`, which gives a $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ of 1.33. Notice how the residuals for this fit look consistent with how we have described `slope_max` in the past. \n",
    "3. Take the slope back to the `best_fit` value of `2.09 N/m` while continuing to keep `Intercept` fixed. Now we adjust the `Slope` downward until it gives a $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ of approximately 1.32. Here we find `slope_min = 2.013 N/m` corresponds to $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ = 1.32.\n",
    "4. The best estimate of the standard uncertainty of the slope is half of the difference between `slope_max` and `slope_min` (the 68% Confidence Interval for the slope), where each of these slopes were found by adjusting the `Slope` until $\\chi^2_\\mathrm{red}$ doubled, approximately. We then additionally apply a factor of $1/\\sqrt{N}$ to include the precision benefits of taking more measurements.\n",
