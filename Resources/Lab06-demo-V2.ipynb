    "Our new goodness-of-fit statistic, $\\chi^2$, allows us to use an improved method to determine the slope uncertainty, which we will demonstrate below. To find `max_slope` and `min_slope`, keep the `intercept` fixed at the value you found for the best-fit line and then adjust the slope (up and down) to approximately double the goodness-of-fit statistic as compared to the best fit. This provides the 68% Confidence Interval for the slope, which you can divide by 2 to get the standard uncertainty for the slope."

    "The steps:\n",
    "1. The best estimate of your slope will be the one from your best-fit model above with the lowest chi-squared. In this example the best-fit model is `slope = 2.08 N/m` and `intercept = 0.0045 m`, which corresponds to a chi-squared of 0.66.\n",
    "2. While keeping `intercept` fixed at `0.0045 m`, we adjust the `slope` upward until our chi-squared is approximately 2*0.66, which is 1.32. Being within 5% of this value (so ~ 1.25 - 1.39) is precise enough so we can use `slope_max = 2.148 N/m`, which gives a chi-squared of 1.33. Notice how the residuals for this fit look consistent with how we have described `slope_max` in the past. \n",
    "3. Take the slope back to the `best_fit` value of `2.09 N/m` while continuing to keep `intercept` fixed. Now we adjust the `slope` downward until it gives a chi-squared of approximately 1.32. Here we find `slope_min = 2.013 N/m` corresponds to chi-squared = 1.32.\n",
    "4. The best estimate of the standard uncertainty of the slope is half of the difference between `slope_max` and `slope_min` (the 68% Confidence Interval for the slope), where each of these slopes were found by adjusting the `slope` until chi-squared doubled, approximately. We then additionally apply a factor of $1/\\sqrt{N}$ to reward you with the precision benefits of taking more measurements.\n",
