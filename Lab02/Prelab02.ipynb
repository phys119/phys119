    "In last week's lab you used Python to calculate $k$ based off of single measurements of $x_1$, $x_2$, $m_1$, and $m_2$. In Lab 02 we will continue with this experiment, with the goal of using iteration to increase the quality of successive measurements. This is reflective of real scientific research, where we are constantly seeking to improve our measurement techniques to get a better understanding of the system we are studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be cumbersome and potentially confusing to define a new Python variable each time we measure a quantity such as $m_2$. A better way to organize data from multiple measurements is in a structure called an array, which we encountered in Lab 00. \n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate data entry into arrays, we will introduce a spreadsheet-like interface for Jupyter notebooks which has been developed specifically for this course, `data_entry2`. It will allow us to easily enter, view and modify our array data. This interface allows us to record our data and then convert these data into Python *vectors* (arrays) to perform subsequent calculations. Our definition of vector is a set of values stored under a single variable name."
