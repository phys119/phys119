The process of *Linearizing* exponential data allows us to continue to use our linear fitting techniques on data that were originally not linear. This prelab uses worked examples to teach you about the linearization process and subsequent analysis. Additionally, we will discuss how to quantify uncertainty in radiation count-rates.\n",

    "1. Most questions in this pre-lab ask you to explain why you can perform a certain step. The explanations do not need to be mathematically rigorous. What we want is a level of detail in your explanation so that a confused peer in the course could read it and understand the “why” part. For example, you might explain a step in an algebraic manipulation of a function as “the function looks like $y=mx+b$ and we know how to fit a graph to this function.”\n",
    "1. For the first two parts of the pre-lab, we omit uncertainties from the examples to focus attention on working with exponential data. However, in the lab you will be using data that includes uncertainties."

    "In this lab we will be using a Geiger counter to detect radiation from a radioactive source. Specifically, we will be using an Iron 55 source, which emits low-energy gamma rays when it decays. The Geiger counter detects ionizing radiation, such as the low-energy gamma rays from this decay. Each particle of ionizing radiation that interacts with the Geiger counter will produce a “count”. There are many factors that influence how many counts will be recorded by the Geiger counter, including how long you count for, how active the source is, how far apart the source and counter are, and how much shielding is in between source and counter.\n",
