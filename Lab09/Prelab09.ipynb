The process of *Linearizing* exponential data allows us to continue to use our linear fitting techniques on data that were originally not linear.

    "1. Most questions in this pre-lab ask you to explain why you can perform a certain step. The explanations do not need to be mathematically rigorous. What we want is a level of detail in your explanation so that a confused peer in the course could read it and understand the “why” part. For example, you might explain a step in an algebraic manipulation of a function as “the function looks like $y=mx+b$ and we know how to fit a graph to this function.”\n",
    "1. For the first two parts of the pre-lab, we omit uncertainties from the examples to focus attention on working with exponential data. However, in the lab you will be using data that includes uncertainties."
