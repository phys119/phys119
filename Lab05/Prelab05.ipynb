    "For many conducting material, the **electric current** ($I$, or simply current) that flows through the material is proportional to the **voltage** ($V$, also known as the electrical potential difference) across it. The constant of proportionality is related to the **electrical resistance** ($R$, or simply resistance) of the material. This relationships holds for many material and across a wide range of voltages and currents, and so, it is given a name: \"Ohm's law\".  Mathematically, Ohm's law is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = IR.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of:\n",
    "- electric current ($I$) is the **ampere**, with symbole A,\n",
    "- voltage ($V$) is the **volt**, with symbol V,\n",
    "- electrical resistance ($R$) is the **ohm**, wth symbol $\\Omega$.\n",

    "As with Hooke's law, **Ohm's law is not a physical law**. Rather, it is an empirical model that provides a satisfactory description of numerous devices and materials under specific circumstances. The goal of Lab 05 and 06 will be, in part, to determine when this model holds and when it fails."

    "In \"**Your turn #10**\", we found that the model decently fit the data for slopes in the range 2.0 - 2.2. How does this range allow us to find the uncertainty in the slope? Given that the residuals are distributed with the same pdf as our $y$ measurements, and that our range was estimated based on the errorbars of our data, which represent $\\pm$ one standard deviation, this range approximately corresponds to the 68% confidence interval for the slope. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to estimate uncertainties in fitting parameters, we will use the method of looking at the range of reasonable best-fit lines and treating that as a 68% confidence interval. As with the standard error of the mean, we will also include a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$ to account for the increased precision due to the fact that our best estimates come from $N$ data point being fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to calculate the uncertainty of the slope:\n",
    "1. Find the steepest possible best-fit line (i.e. the \"max\", as in the maximum slope) that still does a reasonable job of fitting the data.\n",
    "2. Find the least steep best-fit line (i.e. the \"min\", as in the minimum slope) that still does a reasonable job of fitting the data.\n",
    "3. Calculate the range between the \"max\" and \"min\" reasonable values for the slope.\n",
    "4. The range between the maximum and minimum reasonable slope is our 68% confidence interval for the slope, and so we need to divide this difference by 2 to get a standard deviation equivalent.\n",
    "5. To reward us with increased confidence in our result for more data collected, we determine the final uncertainty in our slope by dividing the value from the previous step by $\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is our number of data points being fit.\n",
