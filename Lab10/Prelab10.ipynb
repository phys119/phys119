    "In Lab 09, it is likely that you encountered some unexpected behaviour in your data due to background radiation. And this background radiation likely posed significant challenges when trying to fit a linear model to `Ln(R)` data. In Lab 10, in additional to improving your data set, you will be reanlyzing your Lab 09 data with a new nonlinear model that accounts for this background radiation.\n",

Modify the code below so that it can be used to fit your Lab 09 data. Update your plots so they have appropriate title, axis labels and legends.
